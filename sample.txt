            One foot on the mountain, the other one in the stream,
All kinds of trouble and I'm caught in between,
I can't change my way of doin'; it's gonna lay like it falls,
If I can't go down rockin', I ain't gonna go down at all,
She was a child of acquired money, had that silver spoon,
I knew she had a little wild streak and needed breathing room,
If I can't be your sugar daddy, I won't be your Neanderthal,
If I can't go down rockin', I ain't gonna go down at all,
,
Spent a little time in the congregation, that's how I was raised,
Spent a little time in trouble, but I do have my ways,
,
Won't be your Neanderthal.,
Tonight I had good intentions of crawling into bed,
Resting my body and clearing my head,
But, just about midnight, I got that telephone call,
If I can't go down rockin', I ain't gonna go down at all,

            A vagabond dreamer, a rhymer and singer of songs,
Singing to no one and nowhere to really belong,
I met a beautiful lady, a pure Southern belle of the ball,
Like Scarlet O'Hara loved no one and wanted them all,
,
Chorus:,
I'll never forget you and love you inspite of your faults,
The good and the bad I want to remember it all,
I did a new dance and you did your Tennessee Waltz,
The party's all over I came uninvited,
I'm leaving and taking the belle of the ball,
,
There will always be someone I guess that's the way it should be,
I guess i should know that someone used to be me,
They'll gather around her soon they'll all look the same,
At the feet of the lady are lover's without any names,

In my own way right or wrong,
I don't talk too much about it,
It's something I keep working on,
I don't have too much to build on,
My faith has never been that strong,

There's a man in that old building,
He's a holy man, they say,
He keeps talking about tomorrow,
While I keep struggling with today,
He preaches hell, fire and brimstone,
And heaven seems so far away,
,
I do believe in a higher power,
One that loves us one and all,
Not someone to solve our problems,
Or to catch me when I fall,
He gave us all a mind to think with,
And to know what's right or wrong,
He is that inner spirit,
That keeps us strong,
,
In my own way I'm a believer,
But not in voices I can't hear,
I believe in a loving father,
One I never have to fear,
That I should live life at it's fullest,

Through the chill of winter,

Will the wolf survive?,
Will the wolf survive?,

Verse 2:,

Drifting by the roadside,
Climbs a strong and aging face,
Wants to make some honest pay,
Losing to the rainstorm,

Two strong arms keep him alive,
Will the wolf survive?,

Running scared now forced to hide,
In a land where he once stood with pride,

Verse 3:,
,
Sounds across the nation,
Coming from your hearts and minds,
Battered drums and old guitar,

Will the wolf survive?,
Will the wolf survive?,

There are still places where people like me can hang out,
With nothing at all in this whole world to worry about,
They ain't tore 'em all down yet and said every man for himself,
Or polished them up until nothing worth keeping is left.,
,
Chorus:,
They ain't got 'em all,
If you try here and there,
You'll still find a few holes in the wall,
There an endangered species but i'm keeping track,
I can tell you that they ain't got 'em all.,
,
There are still women who can walk up and change your ways,
Who don't even know they're impossibly beautiful girls,
Who for some crazy reason will hold you so close in the night,
'Til nothing else matters and you finally start feeling all right.,

They ain't got 'em all,
They're still there and their wantin' and wonderfully willing to fall,
There an endangered species but i'm keeping track,

Chorus:,

What a stark contrast to the picture of us standing,
On the edge of giving in and giving up,
,
Something so real don't just disappear,
If it goes away it must go somewhere,
Till we find the answer, we've got to hold on,
Where does love go when it's gone?,
Where does love go when it's gone?,
,
Life's a long highway with a lot of private places,
There's times that we've both thought of finding one,
But there ain't no way we're giving up forever,
It's like saying there won't be a rising sun,
,
Something so real don't just disappear,
If it goes away it must go somewhere,
Till we find the answer we've got to hold on,
Where does love go when it's gone?,
Where does love go when it's gone?,

	Well you think that you can lie and tell me alibis,
	And it's alright,
	Keep the grapevine line working overtime,
	On your late nights,
	You think you can say some words,take away the hurt    ,
	And i'll still be your number one,
	But when it ain't working out we got a saying down South,
	Baby that dog won't hunt,

Verse 2:,
	Well it's been open season on your double dealing,
	And it's so wrong,
	I guess i've been a fool playing by the rules,
	For too long,
	Well i've been sitting here at home with the porchlight on,
	While you've been chasing everything that runs,
	Let me put this in your ear and make it be so clear,
	Baby that dog won't hunt,

            (Written by Larry Butler),
,
Staring at the door,
Every night I'm thinking more and more,
About walking out that door.,
,
I know some day I will,
Although I'm standing still someday I will,
I know someday I will.,
,
Chorus:,
As right as we were we are wrong,
Nothing's going to change what we've done,
The only thing that keeps me from going, babe,
Is wondering what you'll do when I'm gone.,
,
There's somethin' in your eyes,
I swear your eyes are tellin' me goodbye,
Goodbye is in your eyes.,
,
You can call it pride,
But my thoughts of someone else here by your side,
That's killing me inside.,
,
Chorus:,
As right as we were we are wrong,
Nothing's going to change what we've done,

            This place is too damn lonesome I think I'll change and go out for a while,
On second thought where could I go with a closet full of clothes that's out of style,
It's another night of TV or another night of nothin' on my hands,
I gotta change my way of thinkin' 'cause I'm still thinkin' like a married man,
,
CHORUS:,
Suddenly single,
It's hard to break old habits for the bad,
If I wasn't over thirty,
I might just move back in with mom and dad,
,
I should call on some old flame, oh that ain't as easy as it sounds,
My body says I need someone but I heart ain't ready for someone right now,
Maybe in the mornin' I'll wake up and see the light,
Small consolation Lord for the way I feel tonight,

You've got a flaming memory that keeps burning me,
Just when I think you love me, doubt creeps in,
I still feel the shadow of your distant friend.,

It's a major heartache when you lose your trust,
When you love the feeling, it begins to rust,
Just when the sun is shining,clouds set in,
I still feel the shadow of your distant friend.,
,
Chorus:,
I still feel the past each time you touch me,
Will the fire in your mind never end,
I'm so afraid our love may turn to ashes,
I still feel the shadow of your distant friend.,
,
You know I really love you, but your heart's confused,
By that aching fever that keeps haunting you,
Just when I think it's over, it starts again,
I still feel the shadow of your distant friend...,

We live with a monkey and a Chinese acrobat,
She calls me Tex and makes me wear a cowboy hat,
But I don't care 'cause she's a pretty good woman at that,
,
I like nothin' better than to spend my nights at home,
Listen to my baby when she plays my slide trombone,
She talks in tongues, boy that really turns me on,
With a woman like that, a man need never to roam,

BRIDGE:,
Some folks get themselves together,
Some folks stay in Tennessee,
But I don't care where I'm goin',
Just as long as that woman stays with me,
,
Nothin' in the world'd make me treat that woman mean,
She shaves my beard and she keeps my tractor clean,
She burns my food, makes me eat turnip greens,
But I don't care 'cause she's the best little woman I've seen,

            About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war,
I saw my first pistol in the general store,
In the general store when I was thirteen,
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen,
,
l asked if I could have one someday when I grew up,
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up,
Really blew up, I didn't understand,
Mama said,"The pistol is the devil's right hand",
,
The devil's right hand,
The devil's right hand,
Mama said,"The pistol,
Is the devil's right hand,
,
My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt,
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow,
Loads a mite slow and soon I found out,
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out,
,
So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45,
Called a Peacemaker but I never knew why,
Never knew why, I didn't understand,
Mama said, "The pistol is the devil's right hand",
,
The devil's right hand,
The devil's right hand,
Mama said, "The pistol,
Is the devil's right hand",

The devil's right hand,
The devil's right hand,
Mama said, "The pistol,
Is the devil's right hand",

Well I get into a card game in a company town,
Caught a miner cheating, I shot the dog down,
Shot the dog down, I watched the man fall,
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw,
,
The trial was in the morning and they [Incomprehensible] me out of bed,
Asked me how I pleaded, "Not guilty" I said,
"Not guilty", I said, you've got the wrong man,
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand,
,
The devil's right hand,
The devil's right hand,
Mama said,"The pistol,
Is the devil's right hand",

The devil's right hand,

            It's not supposed to be that way,
You're supposed to know I love you,
But it don't matter anyway,
If I can't be there to control you.,
,
Like all the little children,
You've gotta dream a dream or two,
But be careful what you're dreamin',
Or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you.,
,
It's not supposed to be that way,
You're supposed to know I love you,
But it don't matter anyway,
If I can't be there to console you.,
,
When you go out to play this evenin',
Play with fire flies till they're gone,
Then you rush to meet your lover,
Play with real fire till the dawn.,
,
It's not supposed to be that way,
You're supposed to know I love you,
What difference does it make,
If I can't be there to console you?.,

            Hello, it's good to see you,
Just how long has it been,
I've often wondered what i'd say ,
If we ever met again,
If i'd try just being clever,
Or pretend not to remember,
But it's funny how you've lingered,
On my mind,
,
(Chorus:),
Didn't we shine,
Didn't we shine        ,
Didn't we share and care,
And lay our hearts on the line,
Maybe it wasn't meant to last,
'Til the end of time,
Oh,but while it did,
Didn't we shine,
,
I still have some blue days,
That i could do without,
And when i have my blue days,
You're all i think about,
But i've long ago forgiven you,
For what you did or didn't do,
Now all i can recall,
Are the happy times,
,
Chorus ,

Was it my imagination  ,
Or didn't we shine,

            I can hear the wind a blowing in my mind,
Just the way it used to sound through the Georgia pines,
You were there to answer when I called you and me,
Lord knows we had it all.,
,
Remember how I used to touch your hair,
While reaching for the feeling that was always there,
You were the best thing in my life that I recall,
You and me we had it all.,
,
I know that we can never live those times again,
So I let my dreams take me back to where we've been,
Then I'll stay with you girl as long as I can,
Oh it was so good oh so good hmm when I was your man.,
,
Never stop believing in your smile,
Even though you didn't stay it was all worth while,
You were the best thing in my life that I recall,
You and me we had it all. mhm...,

Let her rock me all night long,

            He's a giver he'll give her the kind of attention that she's never known,
He's a helper he'll help her to open the doors that she can't on her own,
He's a lover and he'll love her in ways that she's never been loved before,
He's a getter he'll get her by gettin' her into the world she's been hungering for,
He's a charmer he'll charm her with money and manners that I never learned,
He's a leader he'll lead her across pretty bridges he's plannin' to burn,
He's a talker he'll talk her right off of her feet but he won't talk for long,
Cause he's a doer and he'll do her,
The way that I'd never damned if he won't do her wrong,
He's a taker he'll take her to places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to,
He'll take his time before takin' advantage takin' her easy and slow,
And after he's taken the body and soul she gives him he'll take her for granted,
Take off and leave her taken all of her pride when he goes,
He's a taker he'll take her...,

That woman of mine she ain't happy,
Unless she finds something wrong and has someone to blame,
If it ain't one thing it's another one on the way,

It sure as hell looks just like rain,
But I know where to go on a cloudy day,

Oh rainy day woman,

You have been a friend of mine,rainy day woman,

Always the same, never complain,
Tho’ the times got be tough,
It’s not right for you,
What can I do?,
I can never think of givin’ you up,

Oh rainy day woman,

You have been a friend of mine,rainy day woman,

            Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold.,
They'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold.,
Lonestar belt buckles and old faded levis, ,
And each night begins a new day.,
If you don't understand him, an' he don't die young,,
He'll prob'ly just ride away.,
,
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.,
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks.,
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.,
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.,
'Cos they'll never stay home and they're always alone.,
Even with someone they love.,
,
Cowboys like smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings,,
Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night.,
Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do,,

He ain't wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him,,
Do things to make you think he's right.,

Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.,
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks.,
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.,
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.,
'Cos they'll never stay home and they're always alone.,
Even with someone they love.,

            I've always been crazy and the trouble that it's put me through,
I've been busted for things that I did, and I didn't do,
I can't say I’m proud of all of the things that I’ve done,
But I can say I’ve never intentionally hurt anyone,
,
I've always been different with one foot over the line ,
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind,
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain,
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane,
,
Beautiful lady are you sure that you understand ,
The chances your taking loving a free living man,
Are you really sure you really want what you see,
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be,
,
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane,
Nobody knows if it's something to bless or to blame,
So far I ain't found a rhyme or a reason to change,
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane,

            I'm for law and order, the way that it should be.,
This song's about the night they spent protecting you from me.,
Someone called us outlaws in some ol' magazine,
New York sent a posse down like I ain't never seen. ,
,
Don't you think this outlaw bit has done got out of hand?,
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand.,
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?,
Maybe this here outlaw bit has done got out of hand. ,
,
We were wrapped up in our music, that's why we never saw,,
The cars pull up, the boys get out and the room fill up with law.,
They came pounding through the back door in the middle of the song.,
They got me for possession of something that was gone, long gone. ,

Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun,
I tried to run but i don't think i can          ,
You make one move and you're a dead man friend,
Ain't living long like this,
Can't live at all like this,can i baby?,

Grew up in Houston off the wayside drives,
Son of a carhop and some all night dives,

I live with Angel she's a roadhouse queen,
Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee,

Well my baby you're a looker and I know what you're looking for,
You've been looking over, every man at the bar,
Honey, I know I've got a few years on you,
But if you're shopping around let me tell you a thing or two,
,
Verse 2:,
Well I look a little rough and I got a few miles on me,
My body needs work and my style ain't what it used to be,
And honey I'll admit there's places where I'm wearing thin,
But I ain't broke down, I just couldn't hold it in,
,
Chorus:,
Well I may be worn, but baby I ain't worn out,
Let me take you for a ride and I'll show you what I'm talking about,
I guarantee, there's a lot of me left to love,
Well I may be used but baby I ain't used up,
,
Verse 3:,
I've been wrecked a few times and honey it shows I guess,
There's been once or twice that you could say that I was repossesed,
There's one little thing that I think ought to be understood,
It aint how you look, it's what you got under your hood,

            I was a highwayman,
Along the coach roads I did ride,
With sword and pistol by my side,,
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade,,
Many a soldier shed his life's blood on my blade,,
The bastards hung me in the spring of '25,
But I am still alive;,
 I was a sailor,
I was born upon the tide,
And with the sea I did abide,,
I sailed a schooner 'round the horn to Mexico,,
I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow,,
And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed,,
But I am living still;,
 I was a dambuilder,
Across the river deep and wide,
Where steel and water did collide,,
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado,,
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below,,
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound,
But I am still around,,
I'll always be around, and around, and around, and around...,
 I'll fly a starship,
Across the Universe Divide,
And when I reach the other side,,
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can,,
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again,,
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain,,
But I will remain,,
And I'll be back again, and again, and again, and again...,

"I would walk through Hell on Sunday, to keep my Rose in Paradise...,

He hired a man to tend the garden, ,
and keep an eye on her while he was gone..,

Some say they ran away together... Some say that gardner left alone...,
,
Now the banker is an old man... that mansion's crum-ble-ing down...,
,
He sits all day and he stares at the garden... not a trace of her was,
ever found...,
,
(Chorus),
,
Now there's a rose out in the garden... its beauty cuts just like a knife...,
,
They say that it even grows in the winter time... ,
and blooms in the dead of the night...,

            About fourteen miles out of Abilene,
At a curve in the road and a little stream,
I found out what love's about,
So long ago wonder what I found out,
,
We all got together at the Buffalo Gap,
Granpa Gus ain't got no lap,
He went to heaven in a rocking chair,
What a surprise if he ain't the only one there,
,
You've got a man over eight feet tall,
He can sleep in the kitchen with his feet in the hall,
You ain't much more than five feet two,
I bet you can do anything you've a mind to,

This little song means nothing to you,
Wouldn't matter at all if you wanted it to,
Just part of my life and part of the show,
Ain't that good but I thought you might want to know,

            Do you remember Cactus Texas nothing but a wide place in the road,
Eighteen wheelers never go there main Street's just too narrow for the load,
A little town of honest people some we haven't seen for quite awhile,
I was young and restless and we both were full of dreams and running wild,
,
We left our old hometown and family barely had a nickel to our name,
We were out to win the world not once looking back or losing aim,
We hit the big town and the big time not a lot of effort in the deal ,
But in the bargain we lost touch with one another and old feelings that were real,
,
In a big house up on easy street where too much never seems to be enough,
We're not the same two people far away from all the days when the times were rough,
Including you and I is separated by a wall,
It's not something we can talk about in fact we seldom even talk at all,
,

Even against all the odds I've rolled the dice,
Count me in on any deal that comes around,
Right or wrong never slowed me down.,

I've always loved you silent but strong,
Deep down in your heart you've always known,
It's just that I've made more mistakes than any man under the sun,
You're the only sensible thing I've ever done.,

Never complaining back when the times were bad,
Even when your faith in me was all we had,
Loving me wasn't worth the price you paid,
Darling, I've been wrong this is all I can say.,
I've always loved you silent but strong,
Deep down in your heart you've always known,

            I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told,
I have squandered my resistance,
For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises,
All lies and jests still a man hears,
What he wants to hear and disregards the rest.,
When I left my home and my family,
I was no more than a boy in the company of strangers,
In the quiet of the railway station running scared,
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters,
Where the ragged people go,
Looking for the places only they would know.,
,
Asking only workman's wages,
I come looking for a job but I get no offers,
Just a come on from the whores on Seventh Avenue,
I do declare there were some times when I was so lonesome,
And I took some comfort there.,
,
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade,
And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down,
And cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame,
I am leaving, I am leaving but the fighter still remains...,

Up to now I've been leaving it up to you,
But you'll always be the way you've always been ,
I ain't got the time to go through that again,

I've been wasting time and I'm to blame,
Living with things I couldn't change ,
And the one conclusion I've come to,
I've been wasting time and a lot of good love on you,

I've made up my mind to make my move,
It's just a waste of time to wait on you,
I'm set to leave and you're set in your ways,
You can't change and if you can't I can't stay,

I've turned mine so many times that I damned near wore 'em out,
I've grown used to your abuse and I thought I'd never quit,
But I woke up this morning couldn't find my shiv a git,
,
You've always liked to play your games well I got one for you,
Pretend we're playing checkers girl and it's your time to move,
You'll find your suitcase on the porch and the taxi in the drive,
So get your tongue out of my mouth I'm kissing you goodbye,
,
I see you've finally made it home you been out all night,
Your artificial hair's a mess and your clothes don't fit you right,
I've given and forgiven till there ain't nothing left,
But all you gave was just enough to satisfy yourself,
,
I can smell that whisky in your hair and sen-sen on your breath,
If you ever tried to tell the truth you'd choke yourself to death,
I don't want your nasty kisses and don't tell me no more lies,
Get your tongue out of my mouth I'm kissing you goodbye,

And the Sullen county carnival has been my earn in gold,
I've been quite alone since I remember when,
I turned my ultimatums into chips and cashed them in,
,
I used to run the Ferris wheel but that'd be hard to prove,
I can't stand to see a rolling wheel propped up so it can't move,
I used to run the carousel hell that's just round and round,
Never liked to see them ponies painted up and bolted down,
,
The only thing that keeps me from staying here is leaving,
The only thing that saves me from it all is I'll be gone,
Just when I could trust in all the things that I believe in,
I had to pack it up and move along,
And I'll tell you the boys I'm not the only one,

I was a straight man at the ring toss but that was just a jaunt,
I can't see throwing rings around things you don't really want,
I could run the roller coaster but that might break my heart,
So much hard travelin' just to wind up where you start,
,
Now I just work the gateway and I'm pretty satisfied,
Little booth is red and blue and I just sit inside,
I just take your money and give tickets out in trade,
Think about my life and all the promises I made,

            I sat at a bar having a beer,
Trying to hold down the stool,
When a stranger walked in stood there beside me,
And plopped down there like a fool.,
He started drinking then he started talking,
About things that were wrong in his life,
The more that I heard the more I believed,
The thing that was wrong was his wife.,
You talk about beauty when we first met,
She was all a man could desire,
Talk about love one night with her,
Would set your very soul on fire.,
But loves little flame is out of control,
About three feet high from behind,
Ever since we've been married well, I've come to believe,
That love's for the dumb and the blind.,
'Cause you talk about ugly when she gets mad,
She goes from Jekill to Hyde,
She grits her teeth and her eyes roll back,
And pivot from side to side.,
She completely rewrites the whole English language,
Descriptive four lettered and loud,
Now I can't out think her but I can sure out drink her,
And that's what I'm doing here now.,
I've spent seven years with the wrong woman,
Seven and going on eight,
She spent seven years naggin' and eatin',
I'm overwrought and she's overweight.,
If I try leavin' she has me arrested,
And takes her own sweet time gettin' me out,
If she ain't number one she's in the top two,
Of things that I could live without.,
Men commit murder and all kinds of mayhem,
In a few years they're back on the streets,
Highway robbery and white collar crime,
And they laugh at the system they beat.,
Sometimes I'm tempted sometimes I'm ashamed,
Of the things that the law will allow,
I could have killed her when I first met her,
And I'd have been out of jail by now.,
I could have killed her when we first met,
And I've have been out of jail by now...,

            I want to be free from the noise of the grind,
So I live on the outskirts of the back of my mind,
With a strong hand a songman and God on my side,
I'm writing that freedom a line at a time,
,
On the highway to nowhere that runs through my mind,
A yellow line stretches out into the night,
Broken in places it's my guiding light,
So I'm writing that freedom a line at a time,
,
I'm walking a fine line between wrong and right,
I can live with the problems of this day and time,
Consider me lucky cause I'll be all right,
In my mind I'm having a beautiful life,
,
I'm lost in the feelings of this heart of mine,
In search of the border of infinite time,
And I find peace of mind in the songs and their rhymes,
So I'm writing my freedom a line at a time,

Said together we're one divided we're through,
Divided we're through,

Silver friend at night yellow friend you come with the dawn,
Back in my heart I've been drying my eyes see me run,
So you hang on to me and I'll hang on to you,

            Almost out of adolescence and into a world we didn't know,
Not necessaryly love but in trouble with a fire down below,
Looking back for a feeling it's just something far away and long ago,
I can still recall the name but she's really someone I don't even know,
,
But she was right for the time,
She was right for the time but time has a way of moving on,
,
I do recall a gypsy lady and a younger man in over his head,
I was her believer taken in by every loving word she said,
It was there for the first time the sweet and the bitter taste of love,
When you're young and alive too much never seems to be enough,
,
It seems the young and the innocent are drawn like a moth to a flame,
To the wild and the reckless believing they are one in the same,
She never found a way to separate the good from the bad,
And she never understood that love was all we ever really had,
,
She was right for the time but time has a way of moving on,
With her eyes on tomorrow one day she turned around and I was gone,
I'd have to say in a way she just might be better off alone,
She was right for the time but time has a way of moving on,

            Well the latest news from Nashville,
Ain’t all good, but it ain’t bad,
The worst I ever found there,
Was the best I ever had,
The new hats and the no hats,
Are still coming on pretty strong,
While me and Kris and John and Willie,
Are stilling plodding right along,
,
Clint Black’s moved out to Hollywierd,
He’s in love and that’s a fact,
Done found himself a movie star,
Gonna show him how to act,
Garth Brooks keeps selling millions,
No that sure ain’t no joke,
But I just can’t help looking for,
A pig down in the poke,
,
Have you seen Tanya Tucker,
Hangin’ in there, hangin’ tough,
Her and Dolly Pardon,
Still got much more than enough,
But a few new country ladies,
That I’ve seen go dancin’ past,
Should forget about Madonna,
She ain’t got no country class,
,
Travis Tritt’s got all the talent,
Least it seems that way to me,
He’s a little brash and cocky,
But he’s got a right to be,
Now Billy Ray keeps right on dancin’,
Outta tune and outta time,
He drives Bubbas up the wall,
And girls out of their minds,
,
Livin’ legends are a dying breed,
There ain’t too many left,
To tell the truth, I ain’t been feelin’,
Real hot lately my damn self,
But I ain’t old and I ain’t bitter,
I ain’t mad at anyone,
So don’t go takin’ seriously,
What’s poked at you in fun,
,
But if you’ve ever been to Nashville,
I think you might agree,
We’ve seen a lot of changes,
Things we never thought we’d see,
A rock-n-roller with a banjo,
Now that I might recall,
But a country singer with a brief case,
Beats all I ever saw,

I'm going to Shreveport and on down to New Orleans ,
Been driving these highways,,
Been doing things my way ,
It's been making me lonesome on'ry and mean ,
,
Now her hair was jet black,,
And her name was Codene ,
Thought she was the cream of the Basin Street queens ,
She got tired of that smokey whine dream ,
Began to feel lonesome on'ry and mean ,
,
We got together, and we cashed in our sweeps.,
Gave 'em to a beggar ,
Who was mumbling through the streets,
There's no escaping ,
From his snowy white dreams ,
Born lookin' lonesome on'ry and mean ,

Now i'm down in this valley,,
Where the wheels turn so low ,
At dawn i pray, to the Lord of my soul ,
I say do Lord, do right by me ,

Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind,
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain,

Beautiful lady are you sure that you understand ,
The chances your taking loving a free living man,
Are you really sure you really want what you see,
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be,

            (Luckenbach, Texas / Back to the Basics of Love),
,
There's only two things in life that make it worth livin',
That's guitars that tune good and firm feelin' women,
I don't need my name in the marquee lights,
I got my song and I got you with me tonight,
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love,
,
Let's go to Luckenbach Texas with Waylon and Willie and the boys,
This successful life we're livin' got us feuding ,
like the Hatfield and McCoy's,
Between Hank Williams pain songs, Newberry's train songs,
and blue eyes cryin' in the rain, out in Luckenbach Texas ,
ain't nobody feelin' no pain,
,
So baby let's sell your diamond ring,
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away,
This coat and tie is choking me,
In your high socitey you cry all day,
We've been so busy keepin' up with the Jones,
Four car garage and we're still building on,
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love,
,
Let's go to Luckenbach Texas with Waylon and Willie and the boys,
This successful life we're livin' got us feuding,
like the Hatfield and McCoy's,
Between Hank Williams pain songs, Newberry's train songs,
and blue eyes cryin' in the rain out in Luckenbach Texas,
ain't nobody feelin' no pain,
,
Let's go to Luckenbach Texas with Willie and Waylon and the boys,
This successful life we're livin' got us feuding,
like the Hatfield and McCoy's,
Between Hank Williams pain songs and Jerry Jeff's train songs,
and blue eyes cryin' in the rain out in Luckenbach Texas,
ain't nobody feelin' no pain,

            I've been down the Mississippi,,
Down through New Orleans, ,
Yes, I have.,
I've played in California,,
There ain't too much I haven't seen.,
No, there ain't. ,
Well, I'm a ramblin' man,,
Don't fool around with a ramblin' man. ,
Left a girl in West Virginia,,
Up there where that green grass grows,,
Yes, I did. ,
Another girl in Cincinnati,,
Waitin' where the Ohio River flows,,
Poor girl!,
I'm a ramblin' man, ,
Don't give your heart to a ramblin' man.,
,
You'd better move away,,
You're standin' too close to the flame.,
Once I mess with your mind,,
Your little heart won't beat the same.,
Lord, I'm a ramblin' man, ,
Don't mess around with any ol' ramblin' man.,
Better not!,
,
Well, up in Chicago,,
I was known as "Quiet Boy,",
Yes, I was! ,
Down in Alabama, ,
They call me "The man of joy,",
Still do!,
Well, I'm a ramblin' man,,
Don't fall in love with a ramblin' man.,
,
You'd better move away,,
You're standin' too close to the flame.,

            I've held it all inward, God knows, I've tried,,
But it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life,,
To look in the mirror in total surprise.,
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes. ,
,
Amanda, light of my life.,
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.,
Amanda, light of my life. ,
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.,
,
It's a measure of people who don't understand,,
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band.,
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen, ,
Well I finally made forty, still wearing jeans.,

Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.,

            Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold.,
They'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold.,
Lonestar belt buckles and old faded levis, ,
And each night begins a new day.,
If you don't understand him, an' he don't die young,,
He'll prob'ly just ride away.,
,
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.,
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks.,
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.,
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.,
'Cos they'll never stay home and they're always alone.,
Even with someone they love.,
,
Cowboys like smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings,,
Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night.,
Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do,,
Sometimes won't know how to take him.,
He ain't wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him,,
Do things to make you think he's right.,
,
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.,
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks.,
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.,
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.,
'Cos they'll never stay home and they're always alone.,

            A LONG TIME FORGOTTEN THE DREAMS THAT JUST FELL BY THE WAY,
THE GOOD LIFE HE PROMISED AIN'T WHAT SHE'S BEEN LIVING TODAY,
BUT SHE NEVER COMPLAINS OF BAD TIMES AND THE BAD THINGS HE'S DONE,
SHE JUST TALKS ABOUT THE GOOD THEY'VE HAD,
AND ALL THE GOOD TIMES TO COME,
,
CHORUS:,
SHE'S A GOOD HEARTED WOMAN IN LOVE WITH HER GOOD TIMIN' MAN,
SHE LOVES HIM IN SPITE OF HIS WICKED WAYS SHE DON'T UNDERSTAND,
THROUGH TEARDROPS AND LAUGHTER,
THEY'LL PASS THROUGH THIS WORLD HAND IN HAND,
THIS GOOD HEARTED WOMAN LOVIN' HER GOOD TIMIN' MAN,
,
HE LIKES THE BRIGHT LIGHTS THE NIGHT LIFE,
AND THE GOOD TIMIN' FRIENDS,
AND WHEN THE PARTY'S ALL OVER SHE'LL WELCOME HIM BACK HOME AGAIN,
LORD SHE DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT SHE DOES THE VERY BEST THAT SHE CAN,
SHE'S A GOOD HEARTED WOMAN LOVIN' HER GOOD TIMIN' MAN,

            It's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar,
Where do we take it from here,
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars,
We've been the same way for years,
We need to change,
,
Somebody told me when I got to Nashville,
Son you finally got it made,
Old Hank made it here, we’re all sure that you will,
But I don't think Hank done it this way,
I don't think Hank done it this way,
,
Ten years down the road, making one night stands,
Speeding my young life away,
Tell me one more time just so I understand,
Are you sure Hank done it this way,
Did Ol' Hank really do it this way?,
,
I've seen the world with a five piece band,
Looking at the back side of me ,
Singing my songs and one of his now and then,
But I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way,
No I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way,
,
Take it home,

            I'm for law and order, the way that it should be.,
This song's about the night they spent protecting you from me.,
Someone called us outlaws in some old magazine,
New York sent a posse down like I ain't never seen. ,
,
Don't you think this outlaw shit has gotten out of hand?,
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand.,
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?,
This ain't it, this outlaw shit has gotten out of hand, out of hand. ,
,
We were wrapped up in the music, that's why we never saw,,
The cars pull up, the boys get out and the room fill up with law.,
They came pounding through the back door in the middle of my song.,
They got me for possession of something that was long gone. ,
,
Don't you think this outlaw shit has gotten out of hand?,
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand.,
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?,
This ain't it, this outlaw shit has gotten out of hand, out of hand.,

I don’t look the way the average cowboy singer looks.,
I’ll admit I’ve taken things I never shoulda took.,
You can read a different story in a lot of different books.,
But even then you won’t really know,,
How it was a long time ago.,
,
Women have been my trouble since I found out they weren’t men.,
In spite of that I stopped and took a wife now and then.,
They built their fences high but they couldn’t hold me in.,
I was born with a fire down below,,
And I learned to fly a long time ago.,
,
(Hit it.),

—Instrumental break.—,
,
Don’t ask me about the years I spent out in the rain.,
About the ones I spent in love, or the ones I spent insane.,
And don’t ask me who I gave my seat to on that plane. ,
I think you already know.,
I told you that a long time ago.,
,
Me and ol’ Willie , lordy, we’ve been sold and bought.,
I guess you all heard about some kind of system that we fought.,
We ain’t the only outlaws, just the only ones they caught.,
They tried to run us off but Willie’s slow.,
I quit runnin’ a long time ago.,

Hey.,

When I noticed her the first time,,
I was outside running barefoot in the rain.,
She lived in the house next door,,
Her nose was pressed against the window pane.,
,
When I looked at her she smiled,,
And showed a place where two teeth used to be.,
And I heard her ask her mom,,
If she could come outside and play with me.,
,
Soon the days of sand and shovels,,
Gave way to the mysteries of life.,
Then I noticed she was changing,,
And I looked at her through different eyes.,
,
We became as one and knew a love,,
Without beginning or an end.,
And every day I lived with her,,
Was like a new day dawning once again.,
,
And I've loved her since,,
Every doll was Shirley Temple,,
Soda pop was still a nickel.,
Jam was on her fingertips,,
Milk was circled on her lips.,
,
After many years our love grew silent,,
And at night I heard her cry.,
And when she left me in the fall,,
I knew that it would be our last goodbye.,
,
I was man enough to give her,,
Everything she needed for a while.,
In searching for a perfect love,,
I found that I could not give her a child.,
,
Now she lives a quiet life,,
And is the mother of a little girl.,
Every time I pass her house, ,
My thoughts go back into another world,,
,
Because I see her little girl,,
Her nose is pressed against the window pane.,
She thinks I'm a lonely man,,
Who wants to come inside, out of the rain.,
,
And I've loved her since,,
Every doll was Shirley Temple,,
Soda pop was still a nickel.,
[Fade.],
Jam was on her fingertips,,
Milk was circled on her lips.,

Where i stood,
There was no way that you,
Would stay for good,
But when you left,
I just kept hanging in,
Praying that i see you,
Once again,
And you sure are a sight,
For sore eyes,
Just seeing you again is worth,
Every tear i cried,
Oh don't keep me waiting,
Come inside,
You sure are a sight,
For sore eyes,
,
(Break),
,
Just take me in your arms,
and don't explain,
And kiss away the teardrops,
And the pain,
Don't feel that theirs a thing,
You need to say,
Your here and that's,
What matters anyway,
,
You sure are a sight,
For sore eyes,
Just seeing you again is worth,
Every tear i cried,
Oh don't keep me waiting,
Come inside,
You sure are a sight,
For sore eyes,
You sure are a sight,
For sore eyes,
